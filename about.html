          <h1 id="abt-sar"> About Sarah </h1>
          <p>
            Sarah is a junior at Greenhill School with a passion for art and design.
            From a young age, Sarah has demonstrated her unique talent for experimenting with color through
            different mediums, ranging from colored pencils and crayon to pastels, sketches, and oil paint.
            In 2009, she won her first local art award from the Plano Public Library for creating an illustrious
            bookmark, earning second place. Later, she proceeded to win second place at the Dallas Cottonbowl art contest
            for her creative artwork inspired by the Cowboys' football stadium. Now, she continues to use art as a way
            to communicate ideas, on paper and graphically, as she is the coordinator for graphics for her School
            newspaper, a role made for her. She also has experience with black-and-white photography after taking a
            class at her school. Sarah's most recent illustrations include detailed and complex portraits of
            her sister and mother, vivid water lilies and flowers, as well as a still-life landscape of her school.
            Aside from art and design, Sarah is an excellent student, a setter on her school volleyball team, a writer for her
            school paper and graphics editor, and online editor. In her free time, she enjoys walking her dog, watching movies,
            and baking.
